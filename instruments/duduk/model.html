Time dependant variable:

	<li>reed opening \(h\)</li>
	<li>downsrteam pressure \(p\)</li>
	<li>flow through the reed \(u\)</li>
</ul>

Phyisical constants:

<ul>
	<li>mouth pressure \(p_m\)</li>
	<li>reed frequency \(F_r\)</li>
	<li>reed stifness \(K_r\)</li>
	<li>reed quality factor \(Q_r\)</li>
	<li>reed opening at rest \(H\)</li>
</ul>

The reed is modeled as a one degree of freedom oscillator driven by the pressure differential
\begin{equation}
		\ddot{h}+\frac{\omega_r}{Q_r} \dot{h} + \omega^2_r(h-H) = -(p_m-p) \frac{\omega_r^2}{K}
		\hat{p}(\omega) = Z(\omega) \hat{u}(\omega) \\
		u = w h^+ \mathrm{sgn}(p_m-p)\sqrt{\frac{2|p_m-p|}{\rho}}
\end{equation}

The resonator is described by its input impedance in the Fourier domain
\begin{equation}
	\hat{p}(\omega) = Z(\omega) \hat{u}(\omega) 
\end{equation}
where \(Z\) is decomposed as 
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:impedance_cylinder}
	Z(\omega) = Z_c \sum_n \frac{C_n}{j\omega - s_n}
\end{equation}
where \(Z_c\) represents the characteristic impedance \(Z_c = \frac{\rho c_0}{\pi R^2}\).

Last equation linking the pressure differential to the flow through the reed obtained through Bernoulli's equation, where \(w\) is the reed width,
\(h^+(t)= \max(h(t), 0)\) (so that \(w h^+(t)\) represents the opening section when \(h(t) \ge 0\)) and \(\rho\) is the air density.
\begin{equation}
	u = w h^+ \mathrm{sgn}(p_m-p)\sqrt{\frac{2|p_m-p|}{\rho}}
\end{equation}
